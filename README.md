# A magnetoelastic module for mumax3
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/169079300.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/169079300)

- The module simultanuously solves the elastodynamic and LLG differential equations to simulate magnetoelastic problems. 
- The elastic and kinetic energy densities are added and are available to extract from simulations as well as the magnetoelastic body force and field.
- Both free and periodic elastic boundary conditions are available to utilise.
